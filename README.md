# PumpFun Sniper Bot

It's a Bot for sniping memecoins on Pump.Fun in your CMD. Fully made in Typescript. It uses the Solana blockchain and the Anchor framework to interact with the Pump.Fun bonding curve contract. The bot is designed to be fast and efficient, allowing you to quickly and easily snipe memecoins. It includes features such as automatic token acquisition, automatic price monitoring, and configurable settings.

# Bot speed

The bot works pretty fast, it's in typescript so it will be obviously outperformed by other bots in Go/Rust, tho. That's why it's more likely a toy to experiment & learn than opportunity to earn some Sol.
However, the speed of the script is still second and RPC is another matter.
It is the RPC that determines how fast the tx will go through.
Using a free Quicknode RPC & automatic mode it took around 5-15s to be a coin since it's created.

# Updated Version(with grpc)

In updated version with grpc, I use grpc to get info. It can make my pupmfun sniper bot more fast and esily to buy token within 2s at the first block.
